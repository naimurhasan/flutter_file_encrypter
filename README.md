# File Encrypter

[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/vpre/file_encrypter.svg)](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/file_encrypter)

Super fast file encrypter for flutter. Uses AES-256 in CBC mode with PKCS5 padding.

Supports large files too.

THIS PACKAGE ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED BY  https://github.com/sarbagyastha/file_encrypter
Because he deleted the project, I am creating this null safety repo.

**Supports Android Only for now.** Will be working for iOS soon (Contribution is will appreciated).

# Usage
For Encryption:
```dart
String secretKey = await FileEncrypter.encrypt(
    inFilename: 'open_file.mkv',
    outFileName: 'encrypted_file.dat',
); // key is base64 encoded secret key (PRNG generated).

//Creates `encryted_file.dat`, which is encrypted version of `open_file.mkv`.
```

For Decryption:
```dart
String key = await FileEncrypter.decrypt(
    key: secretKey, // secretKey from above
    inFilename: 'encrypted_file.dat',
    outFileName: 'open_file.mkv',
);

//Creates `open_file.mkv`, which is decrypted version of `encrypted_file.dat`.
```
